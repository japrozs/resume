# Resume

My resume template that is built is with Typst with a configuration file. If you want to customize the data for your own use, you only have to change the [resume.yml](./resume.yml) file.

You can also customize the layout of this resume from a double-column layout by default to a single-column layout by customizing [resume.typ](./resume.typ).

The starting code for this template has been taken from https://github.com/jskherman/cv.typ

Fonts used in this template:

1. Linux Libertine
2. New Computer Modern
3. EB Garamond
